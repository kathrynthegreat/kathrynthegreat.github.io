Deploying to heroku

----------------
#New Additions
----------------

- Add database scripts to create the tables
- Add procfile (web: gunicorn Form:app) #it's module name followed by app instance name
- Add a runtime.txt file so that heroku is using python 3.5.2 #https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-runtimes
- Add a .config file # you will be adding the heroku/amazon database url to this config file

---------------------------
#Changes to existing files
---------------------------

- Make sure .config is now imported into database_helper.py
- Comment out the ports in the run.py

- Set up your heroku account online
- Pip install the heroku belt
- Login to heroku from terminal
$ heroku login
- Set up your git account
- Push the app's code to git
- Make sure the webhooks in git settings are turned on

---------------
#Setup the app 
---------------

- Create your heroku app, cd into your directory with the app
heroku create #this assigns a name to the website 
- Connect heroku to git repo on the site, so that git pushes automatically deploy
- Git remote add the git repo
#http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17366006/fatal-remote-heroku-already-exists
$ git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:anotherformdeployed.git
- Check where you're pushing code to (git and heroku)
$ git remote -v
 
---------------
#Setup the DB 
---------------

- Add heroku postgres manually or heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql
- Get the url to the postgres -> go to the settings page (go here: https://postgres.heroku.com/databases/)
- Pay attention to what that the link is called on heroku, & make sure it's called the same thing in ` DB_URL = os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] ` of the config file 
- Make sure postgres is installed 
brew install postgres
- All the scripts we created should be in ../scripts/
- Spin up the database tables to that remote db using:
$ psql  POSTGRESURL < ../scripts/NAMEOFSCRIPT.pgsql


-------
#Deploy
-------

- Deploy the app, it will never work the first time
 $ git push heroku master
- check your logs for errors
$ heroku logs


-------------
#Extra notes: 
-------------
In database helper you needed to add config for the config vars, and psycopg2.extras is its own module
	import psycopg2.extras
	from .config import *

If you're running this locally you will need to type the following at the command line
$ export DB_URL="postgres://wseppejjqnjtvi:hJwl5G1b5a7dqLHNDWwtVCwrFg@ec2-23-21-193-140.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d8j1gb5nb1v2o7"

In the Procfile, the name of the module is Form, followed by app (before you had it as anotherformcopy)
	web: gunicorn Form:app

Get rid of any dependencies in your requirements file that you don't need

Don't do this if you're not working in a virutal env specific to this app. It will require every package you for python by app
$pip freeze > requirements.txt
