This page is devoted to Minnie and Thorie, adventures extraordinaire. Minne and Thorie are bilingual cats living in New Jersey. They overcame imminent death (Thorie weighted 0.2 lbs) in 2013 and were rescued by the Vasilakys. Minnie and Thorie follow two live feeds: Emergency Kittens and Cute Emergency, and hoped to be featured on there some day. Live every day like it's you last, because one day it will be.
