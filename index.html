						<p>
						I received my PhD in Agricultural and Resource Economics from the University of Maryland, with a focus on development economics and experimental design. I received my BA in Math and Economics from Columbia University and returned to Columbia for a postdoc at Columbia University (2013-present). 
<br></br>
						My research interests are in how groups and social networks intersect with learning and technology adoption, as well as how information is disseminated - with incentives, via networks, or with technology. My secondary interest is in regularization methods (Tikhanov/ridge regression) that address the frequently occurring problem of highly correlated (ill-conditioned) attribute (covariate) matrices in econometrics and big data.
